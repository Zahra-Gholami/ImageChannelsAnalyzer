# Image Channels Analyzer

This project is a Python-based tool for analyzing and manipulating the color channels of images using OpenCV. It provides functionalities to extract, visualize, and process RGB channels, as well as convert images to grayscale for further analysis. 

## Features
- Load images in various formats.
- Extract individual RGB channels (Red, Green, Blue).
- Convert images to grayscale.
- Display channel-wise information such as shapes and values.

## Dataset and Example
The project utilizes the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for demonstration but can work with any image dataset or standalone images. 

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV library (`opencv-python`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zahra-Gholami/ImageChannelsAnalyzer.git
